# Stephen Nunez's Hinge take home assignment
An app to display a single profile with the fields in the order defined by the configuration.

## Libraries used
- Retrofit
    - Network library.
- Hilt
    - I previously only used dagger as my dependency injection library. I decided to use this assignment to learn about hilt. I have read about hilt multiple times and since it is becoming the standard since google developed it. 
- Glide
    - Image loading library.
- GSON
    - Json library

## Assumptions made
- I am assuming that all fields in User is not required. Because of this I made the field in the User mode nullable.
